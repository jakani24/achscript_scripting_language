# achscript_scripting_language
IMPORTANT: Do not use this version, because it is old and does not work properly. Please use https://github.com/jakani24/achscript_2

this is a script interpretor. It is slow and mostly junk...

but if you want to kill your time, you can make some really cool things with it.
